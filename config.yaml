# Units to be used for all speed values
# Options (smallest to largest):
# - bit   = bit/s,    bits per second
# - B     = B/s,      bytes per second
# - Kbit  = Kbit/s,   kilobits per second
# - Kibit = Kibit/s,  kibibits per second
# - KB    = KB/s,     kilobytes per second
# - KiB   = KiB/s,    kibibytes per second
# - Mbit  = Mbit/s,   megabits per second
# - Mibit = Mibit/s,  mebibits per second
# - MB    = MB/s,     megabytes per second
# - MiB   = MiB/s,    mebibytes per second
# - Gbit  = Gbit/s,   gigabits per second
# - Gibit = Gibit/s,  gibibits per second
# - GB    = GB/s,     gigabytes per second
# - GiB   = GiB/s,    gibibytes per second
# Full unit names (e.g. kilobyte) can be used as well
# Note: Capitalization matters for the acronyms above.
units: Mbit

# The minimum upload speed allowed on your torrent client.
# Note: Most torrent clients won't allow you to set the upload speed to 0,
#       so the actual minimum upload speed will be 1 Byte/s.
min_upload: 8

# The maximum upload speed allowed on your torrent client.
# This should be around 70-80% of your total upload speed.
max_upload: 15

# The minimum download speed allowed on your torrent client.
# Note: Most torrent clients won't allow you to set the upload speed to 0,
#       so the actual minimum upload speed will be 1 Byte/s.
min_download: 10

# The maximum download speed allowed on your torrent client.
# This should be around 70-100% of your total download speed.
max_download: 100

# The torrent clients to be used by Speedrr
# Note: If you have multiple clients, Speedrr will split the upload speed between them, based on the number of seeding+downloading torrents.
clients:

  # The type of torrent client
  # Options: qbittorrent
  - type: qbittorrent

    # The URL to your torrent client
    url: <webui_url>

    # The username and password to access your torrent client
    username: <username>
    password: <password>

    # Whether to verify the SSL certificate of the torrent client
    # If you are unsure what this means, leave it as is.
    https_verify: true


# These are the modules that Speedrr will use to determine what upload speed to set.
modules:

  # For monitoring Plex/Jellyfin/Emby streams, via Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, or Tautulli
  # Uses the bandwidth of the streams to determine how much upload speed to deduct.
  media_servers:
    # Supports multiple servers
    # Note: You should only use either plex or tautulli for every Plex Media Server you have.
    
    # The type of server to get data from
    # Options: plex, tautulli, jellyfin, emby
    - type: <server_type>

      # The URL to your Plex/Tautulli/Jellyfin/Emby server
      url: <server_url>

      # PLEX ONLY, the token to access your Plex server
      # Help: https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/
      token: <plex_x_token>

      # TAUTULLI JELLYFIN AND EMBY ONLY, the API key to access your Tautulli/Jellyfin/Emby server
      # Tautulli: Settings > Web Interface > API > API key
      # Jellyfin/Emby: Dashboard > Advanced > API Keys > +
      api_key: <api_key>

      # Whether to verify the SSL certificate of the Plex/Tautulli server
      # If you are unsure what this means, leave it as is.
      https_verify: true
      
      # Bandwidth reported by Plex is multiplied by this value
      # Plex will reserve a higher bandwidth than the actual stream requires all the time,
      # so this value is used to reduce the reported bandwidth, if you want to.
      bandwidth_multiplier: 1.0

      # The interval in seconds to update the Plex stream data
      update_interval: 5

      # Checks if a stream is local, and if it is, it will ignore it from calculations
      ignore_local_streams: true
      
      # After a stream has been paused for this amount of seconds, it will be ignored from calculations
      # Note: To disable this feature, set to -1.
      ignore_paused_after: 300
  

  # Changes the upload/download speed based on the time of day, and what day of the week
  # Note: Recommended to use to set your upload speed to be lower during the day,
  #       when lots of users are using your internet.
  # Note: Supports multiple schedules.
  schedule:
    # The start and end time of the schedule, in 24-hour format
    # Note: Uses your machine's local timezone.
    - start: "05:00"
      end: "23:30"

      # The days of the week to apply the schedule to
      # Options: all, mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun
      # Note: If your end time goes past midnight, you should add the next day as well.
      days: [all]

      # The upload speed deducted in this time period.
      # Note: This can be a percentage of the maximum or a fixed value (uses units specified at the top of config).
      # Example: 50%, 10, 5, 80%, 20%, 0
      upload: 60%

      # The download speed deducted in this time period.
      # Note: This can be a percentage of the maximum or a fixed value (uses units specified at the top of config).
      # Example: 50%, 10, 5, 80%, 20%, 0
      download: 40%
